## What the app does?
The basics of the app are that it will look to see the capacity of the SD and compare it with a table of SD values to see if it falls within the peramiters of a genuine SD.
For example a genuine 256gb SD card should register as no more than 238gb after formatting.. however, many fake cards will show as 249gb, so the app will flag this as fake.

## How accurare is this?
Most fake SD cards on the market are easy to spot as the reported capacity is nowhere near a genuine cards value so this method is usually quite acceptable.
HOWEVER.! if a fake card manufacturer starts using more accurate values then this method would be pointless but i highly doubt that will likely happen and time soon.
